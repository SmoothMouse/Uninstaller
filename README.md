# SmoothMouse Uninstaller

The uninstaller removes all traces of [SmoothMouse](http://smoothmouse.com) from the system, including user preferences and even package receipts. Itâ€™s a slightly better version of the uninstaller that comes with SmoothMouse.

The source code is in AppleScript + Bash. Feel free to use the code under the conditions of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

To build the app yourself, go to the project root and simply run `./make`
